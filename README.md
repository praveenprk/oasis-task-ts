### You can visit the landing page at: https://oasis-task-ts.vercel.app/landing/new-way-to-raise-awareness

### The keyword I am targeting is: `raising awarness`. 

### Why?

I chose the keyword `raising awareness` because as I was going through the repositories in oasis of ideas, I came across a category named `raising awareness`. And it could have been easy to choose `digital product` or `content creation` as keywords but I think those space are too crowded and overused. I chose raising awareness because I have many ideas to raise awareness about such as caste system and its perils as to how it pulls the society back by stopping genetic diversity. I also have the idea of raising awareness in the area of education to be more practical and sensible in terms of STEM, CS to benefit not just an individual but an entire civilization. Ideas like enforcing wise use of AI; laws and policies in place that checks and balance the use of AI by tech giants. Making technologies open source instead of allowing a single giant (monopolists) to control.

### There's more to it!
I don't just want to raise awareness but make sure that people who are serious to bring a change are brought together. Resourceful and wise people if come together, can truly be a force for change that will impact future generations and in turn truly make us a civilized society. Not just a society where people are consumed by materialism, consumerism, profiting, and show off. I chose the keyword `raising awareness` because, I am ambitious enough to think beyond software and digital products. I believe our ideas have the potential to make such a huge impact that even bodies like UN, IMF, World Bank will be compelled to make the change for a better tomorrow.

> In short, I believe in more than just raising awareness; creating that awareness in the reality we live in.
