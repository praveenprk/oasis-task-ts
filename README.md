### The keyword chosen is: `raising awarness`
I chose the keyword `raising awareness` because as I was going through the repositories in oasis of ideas, I came across a category named `raising awareness`. And it could have been easy to choose `digital product` or `content creation` as keywords but I think those space are too crowded and overused. I chose raising awareness because I have many ideas to raise awareness about such as caste system and its perils as to how it pulls the society back by stopping genetic diversity. I also have the idea of raising awareness in the area of education to be more practical and sensible in terms of STEM, CS to benefit not just an individual but an entire civilization. Ideas like enforcing wise use of AI; laws and policies in place that checks and balance the use of AI by tech giants. Making technologies open source instead of allowing a single giant (monopolists) to control.
